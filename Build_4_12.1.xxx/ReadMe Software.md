# Windows
Use the installer provided.  
The installer is no longer signed as it expensive to do so.

You will also need the [Drivers](https://sourceforge.net/projects/usbdm/files/Version%204.12.1/Drivers/) from this page  
The drivers are signed (as they must be under Windows) and will not be updated.

*******
*******
# Linux
It is suggested to build Linux versions from scratch rather than download the DEB here.  
See instructions on this page [GitHub](https://github.com/podonoghue/usbdm-eclipse-makefiles-build)  
There are no driver needed if using the deb installer
