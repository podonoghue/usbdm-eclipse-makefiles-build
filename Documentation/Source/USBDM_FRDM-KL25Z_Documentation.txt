  \mainpage USBDM-FRDM - USBDM Debugger based on Freescale FRDM-xxxx board

 \section introSection Introduction
   The FRM-xxxx boards from Freescale includes a minimal SWD based debugging interface for ARM Kinetis targets.  The interface
   hardware is simple but flexible enough to be used with a wide range of Kinetis devices.  The board includes provision for 
   the connector necessary to allow programming of external devices as well as the target device on the board.  
   
   Unfortunately the existing debugger firmware available with the FRDM-xxxx boards is specifically tied to the target chip on the board 
   (e.g. MKL25Z128M4).  In fact, it is tied to the <b>individual</b> serial number of the <b>chip</b> on the board and cannot even be used to 
   program other otherwise identical devices.  Changing the chip on the board renders the debugging interface useless. 
   
   This manual describes a version of the USBDM firmware that can be loaded into the KL20 based debugging interface on any of the FRDM boards.
   This allows its use as a general purpose programmer and debugger for Kinetis devices (including the on board target chip e.g. KL25 on the board).
   This provides a very inexpensive debugging tool.
    
   While the USBDM firmware may be used with any of the FRDM-xxxx boards it is recommended to use a FRDM-KL25Z or FRDM-K20D50M board as some of the early
   versions of the other boards have various hardware errors that make connection to an external device difficult.
   
 \subsection featureSection Features
   This version of the USBDM code combined with the FRDM-xxxx board provides the following features:
   -	A SWD interface for programming and debugging of <b>Kinetis ARM-Cortex</b> microcontrollers.
   -  Both the on-board target device (e.g. MKL25Z128M4) and external devices may be programmed.
   -  Installation of the USBDM software does not require any tools other than the FRDM-KL25Z board.
   -  Compatible IDEs
      - Codewarrior V10.x (Eclipse version). The following features are provided:
         - Kinetis - Integration of <i>USBDM debug interface</i> in wizards and debug functions.
      - Eclipse (including Freescale Kinetis Design Studio). The following features are provided:
         - Kinetis <i>New Project Wizard</i>
         - Kinetis <i>USBDM debug target</i>
         - Integration of GCC tools (GNU tools for ARM or KDS tools)
         - Peripheral Register view tailored for Kinetis devices.
   -  Stand-alone Kinetis programmer utility.
   -  Linux compatible
   -  Windows compatible
   -  The Firmware in the BDM may be updated using the usual FRDM-KL25 Bootloader function.
   -  The original board software may be restored if USBDM is not found suitable.  

<b>The capabilities and features of the USBDM interface varies between the different versions of hardware. 
Not all of the functionality described in the following pages may apply to this version.</b>

 \section sectionCredits Credits
   -  The original base code is taken from the TBDML, OSBDM and TBLCF projects and I very much appreciate
      the effort involved in producing the original code.  I hope this extension will be useful.
