\section USBDM API Example

   Programming with the USBDM API is pretty straightforward.  The documentation for the public API
   is documented in \ref USBDM_API.h.
   
   Below is a simple example of using the API to dump the entire flash from a MC9S08JM60 chip. You can click on 
   the various functions and definitions used in the example to obtain more information.
   
   A similar example is available from the USBDM examples if the Eclipse plugin is installed.

\include USBDMExample.cpp
