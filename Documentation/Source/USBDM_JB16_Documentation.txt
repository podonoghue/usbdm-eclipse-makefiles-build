 \mainpage USBDM (combined TBDML/OSBDM code) for JB16 (Obsolete)

 \section introSection Introduction
<b>
   Please note that these designs are obsolete.\n\n
   The JB16 chip used in these designs have a ROM firmware flaw which makes it impossible to reprogram the chip firmware.
   When the chip is in bootloader mode it fails to enumerate properly under Windows 7 or 8 and later updates of WIN-XP.
   Because of this it is not possible to update the firmware which make it impractical to support them.\n\n
   The USBDM software <i>may</i> still work to some extent but I cannot make any guarantees.\n\n
</b>     
   The main purpose in providing this version is so that existing users of JB16 based
   USBDMs or TBDML or OSBDM can upgrade to a system that is usable with the current
   Codewarrior tools and the USBDM programmers provided. \n\n
   The attached files provide a port of a combined TBDML/OSBDM code to a MC9S08JB16 processor.  
   The primary motivation for this was to produce a single BDM that could be used with the HC12
   and HCS08 microcontrollers without needing to change the firmware in the BDM between uses.  
   Other features have also been added.\n
   Some of these features may be gained by using the software alone, others require extended hardware.
   There are versions of the software provided that are compatible with the several existing versions
   of the OSBDM hardware that have become available at different times.

 \subsection featureSection Features
   This version of the code & BDM hardware provides the following features:
   -	A single BDM interface for programming and debugging of the following targets:
      -  <b>HCS12</b> (including those without SYNC feature (e.g. 9S12DP256B)
      -  <b>HCS08</b>
      -  <b>RS08</b>
      -  <b>Coldfire V1</b>
\if Coldfire   -	\b Coldfire \b V2, \b V3 & \b V4 microcontrollers  \endif

   -  Compatible IDEs
      - Codewarrior V10.1 (Eclipse version)
        - Tested on Windows-XP-32bit, Windows-7-32bit, Windows-7-64bit
        - Tested on Ubuntu-32-bit
      - Codewarrior Legacy versions
        CodeWarrior Development Studio for HCS12(X) V5.1 & \n
        CW for Microcontrollers V6.3 (RS08 is not supported\n
         - Tested on Windows-XP-32bit, Windows-Vista-32bit
      - Initial support for CodeSourcery Lite for Coldfire
         - Tested on Windows-XP-32bit

   -  Trimming of target internal clock (Eclipse version or standalone programming tools only).
   -  Vista compatible
   -  Linux compatible
   -  Software triggered in-circuit-programming (ICP) of the microcontroller for update of Firmware.  No links on
      the hardware are required.
   -	Hardware is physically small
       
\if Power
   -  Target Vdd supply & control.  This allows the target power to be cycled when required for a reliable reset into BDM mode.
      It is also (obviously) convenient since it allows debugging small target boards without a separate target power supply.  
      An external target supply may also be used instead.  The Target supply is protected by a polyfuse and software detection
      of overload.
\endif
   -  HCS12, HCS08, RS08, Coldfire V1 specific features:
   -  Target reset detection & control (required for HC12 processors).  This allows HC12 processors to be reset into BDM mode
      as required for debugging.
\if Power
   -  Target Vdd monitoring. This allows the hardware to detect changes in the Target supply to provide reliable resetting into
      BDM modes on HCS08 and RS08 microcontrollers.  It also is used to implement the target power supply protection.
\endif
      - A slightly higher BDM interface speed than the existing JB16 OSBDMs. Up to 40MHz. (BDM clock 20MHz).
      -  Automatic re-connection.  The software has an option to continuously update the interface speed to prevent loss
         of communication if the target BDM interface speed changes (as may occur with clock changes on some targets).
      -  Control of BDM clock selection in HC12/HCS08/Coldfire microcontrollers.  Most of these targets provide an alternative
         BDM clock selection.  This can have advantages when connecting to high speed targets as the alternative clock may 
         operate at a lower speed.
\if Power
      -  Selection of 3.3V and 5V target supply (if hardware supports this).
\endif
      -  Trial-and-error determination of communication speed for earlier HC12 targets.
      -  User prompting for target supply cycling with BKGD low as may be needed for HCS08 targets
      -  Various bug fixes on the OSBDM code.
\if Coldfire
   -  Coldfire V2,3,4 specific features and limitations:
   -  Higher communication speed with target - The target communication speed may be selected.
   -  The BDM uses asychronous communication with the target i.e. the BDM signals are not synchronized with the target clock.  
      This means that the BDM should not be used with early Coldfire targets.  Check the description of the BDM interface
      timing in the appropriate Coldfire Processor manual to determine if this limitation applies.

   Please refer to the following documents for hardware design details:
   - The 'deluxe' USBDM-JB16 is no longer recommended and the PCB designs have been removed.  Please refer to the V3.2 documentation
     information or consider the JMxx or JS16 versions for more current designs.

 \section capabilitiesSection Capabilities
      The software is compatible with several of the TBDML/OSBDM hardware variants that are available.  
      Capabilities will vary with the actual hardware.
      The table below summarises the capabilities of the BDM for various hardware options:

      I do not have access to the last 2 hardware alternatives so they HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED! 
      I also believe the last three have a minor hardware design problem.

 \section sectionCredits Credits
   -  The original base code is taken from the TBDML, OSBDM and TBLCF projects and I very much appreciate
      the effort involved in producing the original code.  I hope this extension will be useful.

   -  The hardware interface is based on TBDML and Freescale USBSPYDER08.
