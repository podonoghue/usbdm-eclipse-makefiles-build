\section Preamble

   The CF_Unlocker utility allows coldfire V2, 3 and 4 chips to be unsecured 
   and erased using the JTAG interface.\n

   Most of the Coldfire chips require certain signals to be changed to enable the 
   JTAG interface.  Check the details of your hardware and ensure that any required links have 
   been changed before running <b>CF_Unlocker</b>.
      
\section RunningCF_Unlocker Running CF_Unlocker
 
   -  Run <b>CF_Unlocker</b>\n
      The usual USBDM/CF JTAG connection dialogue will appear.  This allows the interface to 
      the target to be configured.  See \ref configuringCFVxPage for more details of this dialogue.\n
      
   -  The following dialogue will then open:\n\n
      \image html CF_Unlock_basic.png
      
   -  Much of the information in this dialogue is completed automatically if the target device is
      'known' to the software.  There is a configuration file provide <b>CF_Unlocker.cfg</b> that 
      contains information about a few common devices.  Descriptions of other devices may be added
      to this file.  
   -  The following description assumes that a single know device is found so only Steps <b>one</b>,
      <b>three</b> and <b>six</b> need attention.

  \subsection StepOne Step one - JTAG Chain
   -  Press <b>Initialise JTAG chain</b> to have the BDM scan the JTAG chain for devices.\n
      
   -  After scanning the JTAG chain the <b>JTAG Device #</b> drop-down box will be populated with 
      an entry for each device found in the JTAG chain.  There would usually only be a single 
      device - the coldfire target.\n
      A recognized device will be described by part name e.g. <b>0. MCF5211</b>.  

  \subsection StepTwo Step Two - Select device in chain to erase
   -  No selection is needed here for the usual case of a single device in the JTAG chain.
      Details about the device will be displayed.
  
  \subsection StepThree Step Three - Select target device type and speed
   -  Device type would normally be selected automatically for a known device.\n
   
   -  <b>Target speed</b> - The target speed is used to determine the correct Flash clock divider
      value.  This value <b>must</b> be provided for automatic calculation of Flash parameters.
   
  \subsection StepFour Step Four - Select Flash clock limits and equation
   This information would normally be selected automatically for a known device.
   -  <b>Minimum Frequency</b> - The minimum frequency allowed for the Flash clock (usually 150kHz).
   -  <b>Maximum Frequency</b> - The maximum frequency allowed for the Flash clock (usually 200kHz).
   -  Only a single Flash divider equation is available - I believe all the Coldfire devices use
      this equation.
  
  \subsection StepFive Step Five - Select erase parameters
   Again this information would be determined automatically for a know device.  
   -  <b>Unlock Instruction</b> - This is the JTAG <b>LOCKOUT_RECOVERY</b> instruction used to initiate the
      Flash erase (usually 0x0B).
      
   -  <b>Clk Divider value</b> - This is the required value for the <b>JTAG_TFM_CLKDIV</b> register.  This
      is the same as the <b>CFMCLKD</b> - CFM Clock Divider Register value described in the Flash section 
      of the relevent user manual.  It is calculated from the Target clock frequency, Minimum and Maximum 
      Flash clock frequencies and the Flash divider equation. \n

   \subsection StepSix Step Six - Unlock and Erase
   -  Press this button to erase the selected device.

\section Preamble

   The CF_Unlocker utility allows coldfire V2, 3 and 4 chips to be unsecured 
   and erased using the JTAG interface.\n

   Most of the Coldfire chips require certain signals to be changed to enable the 
   JTAG interface.  Check the details of your hardware and ensure that any required links have 
   been changed before running <b>CF_Unlocker</b>.
      
\section RunningCF_Unlocker Running CF_Unlocker
 
   -  Run <b>CF_Unlocker</b>\n
      The usual USBDM/CF JTAG connection dialogue will appear.  This allows the interface to 
      the target to be configured.  See \ref configuringCFVxPage for more details of this dialogue.\n
      
   -  A dialogue similar to the following will open:\n\n
   <table border="0">
   <tr>
   <td>
      \image html CF_Unlock.png
      <b> \n Dialog after a known device is selected</b>      
   <td>
      \image html CF_Unlock_Unrecognized.png
      <b> \n Dialog after an unknown Freescale device is selected</b>      
   </table>      
   \n
   - Much of the information in this dialogue is completed automatically if the target device is
     'known' to the software.  There is a configuration file provide <b>CF_Unlocker.cfg</b> that 
     contains information about a few common devices.  Descriptions of other devices may be added
     to this file.

  \subsection StepOne Step one - JTAG Chain
   -  Press <b>Initialise JTAG chain</b> to have the BDM scan the JTAG chain for devices.
     
   -  After scanning the JTAG chain the <b>JTAG Device #</b> drop-down box will be populated with 
      an entry for each device found in the JTAG chain.  There would usually only be a single 
      device - the coldfire target.\n\n
      If the device is recognized then it will be described by part name e.g. <b>1. MCF5211</b>.  
      Otherwise it may be described as:
      - <b>Unrecognized</b> - A Freescale device was found but the software doesn't have a 
         description of how to erase it. \n
         Some manual configuration of the erase parameters must be done in the later steps.
      - <b>Non-Freeescale</b> - A non-Freescale device was found.  This (obviously) may not
         be erased.
      - <b>No JTAG IDCODE</b> - A device was found but it does not support the JTAG IDCODE 
         instruction so no information is available. This device may not be erased.\n

  \subsection StepTwo Step Two - Select device in chain to erase
   -  Devices in the JTAG chain may be selected from the <b>JTAG Device #</b> drop-down box.
      Information about the selected device will be displayed and other parts of the dialogue will be 
      updated accordingly.
   -  If the JTAG chain contains <b>more than one</b> unrecognized device and the device being erased 
      is not the <b>first</b> or <b>last</b> in the chain then it will be necessary to enter the JTAG 
      instruction register length for each unknown device.  Select each unknown device in turn and 
      enter the IR length in the box next to the device name.
   -  Select the device to be erased from the <b>JTAG Device #</b> drop-down box before proceeding to
      the next step.
  
  \subsection StepThree Step Three - Select target device type and speed
   Device type would normally be selected automatically for a known device.\n
   
   -  <b>Device Type</b> - If the device is not recognised, but you are confident of the device
      type or know that it is similar to another device, then the device type may be selected here.
      If the device type is not available in the list box then select <b>Custom</b> and complete 
      the remaining parts of the dialogue.
   -  <b>Target speed</b> - The target speed is used to determine the correct Flash clock divider
      value.  This value <b>must</b> be provided if automatic calculation of Flash parameters is used.
   
  \subsection StepFour Step Four - Select Flash clock limits and equation
   This information would normally be selected automatically for a known device.  If the device is 
   not recognised then it <b>must</b> be provided manually.  Please refer to the Flash section of
   the user manual for the device being used.
   -  <b>Minimum Frequency</b> - The minimum frequency allowed for the Flash clock (usually 150kHz).
   -  <b>Maximum Frequency</b> - The maximum frequency allowed for the Flash clock (usually 200kHz).
   -  Only a single Flash divider equation is available - I believe all the Coldfire devices use
      this equation.
  
  \subsection StepFive Step Five - Select erase parameters
   Again this information would be determined automatically for a know device and target clock frequency.  
   Alternatively, it may be entered manually after referring to the user manual for the device being used.
   -  <b>Unlock Instruction</b> - This is the JTAG <b>LOCKOUT_RECOVERY</b> instruction used to initiate the
      Flash erase (usually 0x0B).
      
   -  <b>Clk Divider value</b> - This is the required value for the <b>JTAG_TFM_CLKDIV</b> register.  This
      is the same as the <b>CFMCLKD</b> - CFM Clock Divider Register value described in the Flash section 
      of the relevent user manual.  It is calculated from the Target clock frequency, Minimum and Maximum 
      Flash clock frequencies and the Flash divider equation. \n
      The method used to calculate this value is different to that given in
      the Coldfire User Manuals. The value calculated here is the one that results in a Flash clock frequency 
      nearest to the middle of the permitted Flash Clock range.  This value is more conservative than that
      arrived at by the recommended method.  This is to take account of possible clock speed variation if 
      an untrimmed internal clock is being used by the target.

   \subsection StepSix Step Six - Unlock and Erase
   -  Press this button to erase the selected device.
