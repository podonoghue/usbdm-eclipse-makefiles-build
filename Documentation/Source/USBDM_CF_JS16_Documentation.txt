  \mainpage USBDM/CF (combined Coldfire V2,3,4/DSC/Kinetis BDM) for JS16

 \section introSection Introduction
   The attached files provide a port of a combined TBLCF/DSC code to a MC9S08JS16 processor.  
   The primary motivation for this was to produce a single BDM that could be used with a range of Freescale microcontrollers.
   Other features have also been added.
   The software may also be used to provide an on-board BDM for the Axiom MCF8006Demo board. Strangely, this
   board has a complete DSC BDM built-in but the firmware is not present.  You will need a HCS08 BDM to do this
   upgrade - No warranty - do this at your own risk.

 \subsection featureSection Features
   This version of the code & BDM hardware provides the following features:
   -	A single BDM interface for programming and debugging of the following targets:
      -  <b>Coldfire V2, \b V3 & \b V4</b> microcontrollers
      -  <b>Kinetis ARM-Cortex</b> microcontrollers
      -  <b>MC56F80xx</b> Digital Signal Controllers (Limited range of devices in CW 10 & stand-alone programmer)
   -  No re-flashing of the BDM is required when changing between targets
   -  Compatible IDEs
      - Codewarrior V10.1 (Eclipse version)
        - Tested on Windows-XP-32bit, Windows-7-32bit, Windows-7-64bit
        - Tested on Ubuntu-32-bit
      - Codewarrior Legacy versions
        CW for Coldfire V7.1
        CodeWarrior for DSC56800E v8.3 (USBDM-JMxx-CF or MC56F8006Demo board only)
        - Tested on Windows-XP-32bit, Windows-Vista-32bit
      - Initial support for CodeSourcery Lite for Coldfire
         - Tested on Windows-XP-32bit
      - Initial support for Coldfire Flasher (CFFlasher)
         - Tested on Windows-XP-32bit
   -  Higher USB communication speed cf. JB16 version BDMs (USB full speed cf. USB low speed)
   -  Vista compatible
   -  Linux compatible
   -  Initial Firmware programming may be done without a BDM using the JS16 USB bootloader ROM.
   -  The Firmware in the BDM may be automatically updated using an in-circuit-programming (ICP) feature.
   -	Hardware is physically small
       
\if Power
   -  Target Vdd supply & control.  This allows the target power to be cycled when required for a reliable reset into BDM mode.
      It is also (obviously) convenient since it allows debugging small target boards without a separate target power supply.  
      An external target supply may also be used instead.  The Target supply is protected by a polyfuse and software detection
      of overload.
\endif
   -  HCS12, HCS08, RS08, Coldfire V1 specific features:
   -  Target reset detection & control (required for HC12 processors).  This allows HC12 processors to be reset into BDM mode
      as required for debugging.
\if Power
   -  Target Vdd monitoring. This allows the hardware to detect changes in the Target supply to provide reliable resetting into
      BDM modes on HCS08 and RS08 microcontrollers.  It also is used to implement the target power supply protection.
\endif
      -	A higher BDM interface speed than the existing JB16 OSBDMs. Up to 56MHz. (BDM clock 28MHz).
      -  Automatic re-connection.  The software has an option to continuously update the interface speed to prevent loss
         of communication if the target BDM interface speed changes (as may occur with clock changes on some targets).
      -  Control of BDM clock selection in HC12/HCS08/Coldfire microcontrollers.  Most of these targets provide an alternative
         BDM clock selection.  This can have advantages when connecting to high speed targets as the alternative clock may 
         operate at a lower speed.
\if Power
      -  Selection of 3.3V and 5V target supply (if hardware supports this).
\endif
      -  Trial-and-error determination of communication speed for earlier HC12 targets.
      -  User prompting for target supply cycling with BKGD low as may be needed for HCS08 targets
\if Coldfire
   -  Coldfire V2,3,4 specific features and limitations:
   -  Higher communication speed with target - The target communication speed may be selected.
   -  The BDM uses asychronous communication with the target i.e. the BDM signals are not synchronized with the target clock.  
      This means that the BDM should not be used with early Coldfire targets.  Check the description of the BDM interface
      timing in the appropriate Coldfire Processor manual to determine if this limitation applies.

 \section differenceSection Differences to JB16 TBLCF etc
   -  The PCB artwork provided is for a double-sided plated-through-hole board using surface mount components.
      This seems a reasonable decision since the processor is only available in a SMT package in any case.  It
      is possible to prototype the board using a non-PTH board but the required vias may present problems as they are
      beneath components and need to be replaced with feed through wires. \n
      The above images are for a milled board that was hand assembled.      
   -  Software drivers (tblcf.dll etc) need to be installed so that advantage can be taken of the new features.

 \section sectionCredits Credits
   -  Some of the code is based upon the TBLCF and OSBDM-JM60 projects and I very much appreciate the effort involved in producing
      the original code.  I hope this extension will be useful.
