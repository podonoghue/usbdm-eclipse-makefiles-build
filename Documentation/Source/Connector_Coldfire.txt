 \section sectionColdfireBDMConnectorUSBDM_JMxx Coldfire BDM Connector for USBDM_CF_JMxx (full 26-pin connector)
   -  There are several options for how the connection to the Coldfire processor may be made
   - A <b>right-angle</b> socket may be soldered to the <b>rear</b> of the BDM module.  This allows the BDM to connect 
     directly to the target with the BDM vertical i.e. at right-angle to the target board.\n

   - A <b>staight</b> socket may be soldered to the <b>rear</b> of the BDM module.  This allows the BDM to connect 
     directly to the target with the BDM horizontal and extending from the edge of the target board.
     This requires that the connector on the target board has been correctly orientated and positioned near an edge.\n

   - A <b>plug or simple male header</b> may be soldered to the <b>top</b> of the BDM module.  A 26-way ribbon cable is then 
     used to make the connection to the target BDM connector.  The ribbon cable should be kept short.  A reduced cable
     may be used as described in the next section.\n

 \section sectionReducedCable Reduced pin-count cable
   -  The original TBLCF suggested the use of a reduced pin-count connector and cable.  This version supports a 
      similar arrangement but I advise that the cable be constructed as shown in the figure below:\n

   - This cable maintains the correct impedance for all the retained signal connections and avoids 
     the need to remove pins from the BDM connector.

 \section sectionColdfireBDMConnectorUSBDM_JS16 Coldfire BDM Connector for USBDM_CF_JS16 (reduced 10-pin connector)
   - The JS16 version BDM uses a 10-pin reduced size connector for the Coldfire connector.  Most targets provide a 
     26-way connector so a transition is required.  (It is also possible to use a 26-way cable plugged in offset.)

   - Make sure the connector is plugged in correctly as shown below - The jumper pins are NOT part of the connector.
