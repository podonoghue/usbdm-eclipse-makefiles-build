\section EclipseWizard Using the New Project Wizard to create a Project with USBDM support

Support in Codewarrior V10.x is available as follows:
   - RS08
   - HCS08
   - Coldfire V1
   - Coldfire V2,3,4.
   - Kinetis
   - DSC support in very limited - Debugging may be unreliable.

 USBDM is fully supported by the Codewarrior <b>New Project Wizard</b>.  The following shows the required initial 
 steps of creating a USBDM project using the wizard.

   -  Start the wizard from the pop-up menu in the Project Explorer window or from the main Menu, for example <b>New->Bareboard Project</b>. \n\n
      \image html "eclipseNewProjectWizard1.png"
   -  Choose a suitable name for the project. \n\n
      \image html "eclipseNewProjectWizard2.png"
   -  Select the target device or board for development. \n\n
      \image html "eclipseNewProjectWizard3.png"
   -  Select the USDBM connection and any other connections required. \n\n 
      \image html "eclipseV10_1_NewProjectWizard4.png"

The remaining pages of the Wizard are independent of the target connection and allow a range of options 
and alternative for the project.  If only a basic project is needed it is sufficient to click <i>Finish</i> 
now. This will create a new project with a <b>Remote System</b> connection for USBDM.  \n
It may be desirable to change some of the default settings to suit your BDM. This will be the case
if you wish to trim the target clock or use the power supply features of the BDM. The following section
describes the USBDM specific settings available.
<hr>
The <i>Remote System</i> dialogue for USBDM may be accessed in two ways (that I know of!):
- Locate the connection in the Remote Systems tab which is usually one of those at the bottom of the Eclipse Workspace:
There will be a line for each remote entry in the the workspace.  Note that it possible to share these systems between 
different projects but they must have the same target device.  For the example created above, this Remote System will be called 
<b>MyFirstUSBDMProject_MC9S08AC128_USBDM</b>. 
 \image html "RemoteSystemsTab.png"
 
- Alternatively, locate the connection through the debug settings for the project:

To view the USBDM Debug Options select the Debug Configuration at the left and then click on the <i>Edit</i>
 button in the Remote Settings area. 
  
  \image html "SelectingUSBDMLaunchOptions_V10_1.png"
 
   The various options are discussed in the following sections  

   Some of the following options may be absent from the dialogue for a particular target. \n
   Some options may have no effect depending upon the hardware capabilities of the BDM interface connected 
   during the actual debugging session. \n\n

<b>Common options</b>
   - <b>Connection Name:</b> An arbitrary name used to identify this target connection. 
   - <b>Description:</b> Descriptive text - change as desired to describe the connection. 
   - <b>System type:</b> This identifies the target device e.g. MCF51CN128 etc
   - <b>Connection type:</b> This allows selection between all the connections available for the device chosen above. \n
      The USBDM connections available are:
      - USBDM RS08 Interface
      - USBDM HCS08 Interface
      - USBDM Coldfire V1 Interface
      - USBDM Coldfire V2,3,4 Interface
      - USBDM ARM interface

         interface speed to prevent loss of communication in this case.  \n\n
      - <b> Drive RESET signal -</b> Many of the target microcontrollers do not have a dedicated 
         reset signal.  This is not a problem as it is possible to reset the target using the BKGD mode
         commands through the BDM interface.  However, the RESET signal on the BDM interface will
         often still be connected to the Reset signal of the processor.  This option allows the

      - <b> None -</b> The device will not be erased.  This is only useful if the device is blank in the regions to be programmed. \n
      - <b> Mass -</b> A mass erase/unsecure operation will be done using a target specific unsecure method.  This may also involve
        programming of default security information.  This method is applicable to a secured device.  Please refer to the Flash 
        programming manual for more details. \n

         without entry to pending interrupt routines.  If this option is not selected then stepping may result in 
         movement to the 1st instruction of the pending interrupt routine - usually not desired. This function is
         achieved by setting the I-bit in the CCR before each step and restoring the original value afterwards.  I
         have tried to check for all <i>special</i> case instructions (e.g. SEI or CLI) and I believe this option
         is safe to use.  Note that execution of a WAIT instruction will always cause entry to pending interrupt routines.

 \section EclipseLaunchConfiguration Manually Creating a Launch Configuration for USBDM
 <b>
 Since USBDM is now supported by the Codewarrior New project Wizard the following process is no longer necessary.  
 It is included as a reference to what the various setting do rather than as a necessary process. \n\n
 </b>
 
The following describes manually creating a custom <b>Debug Launch Configuration</b>. The configuration can
 then be used to launch a debug session. \n\n
The following outlines the steps required to create the Debug Launch Configuration. This should be read in
conjunction with the Codewarrior V10 quickstart manual. It is assumed that a suitable application has been
created beforehand. \n\n
The following example is for a Coldfire V1 device. The settings for a RS08 or HCS08 device would be almost
identical. The required changes are indicated where appropriate. \n\n
<em>Programming the flash of Coldfire V2,3,4 devices is not supported so some sections are not appropriate to
those devices. It is necessary to program the device using the Flash programmer before debugging or as a 
autorun task setup as part of the Debug Launch Configuration</em>. \n\n

      The USBDM GDI dll has a built in flash programmer that handles the programming of the target non-volatile
      memory (in RS08, HCS08, CFV1 and Kinetis targets).
      The options selected cause USBDM to program the target on initial download with a new debug session but
      not to re-program if the debugger session is re-started. This prevents the Flash from being needlessly 
      re-programmed.
      
      The verify options may be selected but USBDM already verifies programming so this is unnecessary. Also, it
      is possible for the Codewarrior verify to fail as USBDM may modify the data programmed to the target
      memory to support trimming of the target clock or disabling target security to allow debugging.

          The Programming of Coldfire V2, 3 & 4 targets is not supported by the USBDM GDI interface. It is necessary to
          program the target using the Codewarrior flash programmer before each debugging session. You may add a task on this 
          dialogue so that this is done every time the debugger is launched.
          
          Before proceeding make sure that you have already have a Flash programming Target Task 
          suitable for the target device you are using. By default Codewarrior will have created 
          such a task when the project was created (for a Coldfire V3-4 target).  If necessary see 
          \ref eclipseFlashProgrammingPage "Coldfire V2-V4 Flash programming" for instructions on creating one.

          - Click on the <b>add</b> button to open a dialogue to add a new task.
             - Select the Flash programming task created earlier within the drop-down box
             - Select then <b>Execute on initial launch</b> checkbox 
             - Unselect then <b>Execute on successive runs</b> checkbox\n to prevent repeated 
               programming of the flash if you restart the debugging session.
