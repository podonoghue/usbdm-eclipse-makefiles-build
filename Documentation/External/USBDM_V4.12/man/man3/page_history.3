 To support the 64-bit version of Windows it has been necessary to update to using libusb-V1 drivers\&. For consistency this is also done on Linux\&. As part of this process the VID/PID for the hardware (BDM) has been changed\&. This will allow the co-existence of Freescale's OSBDM-JM60 hardware while using a new driver for USBDM\&.

Support for Codewarrior V10 has been introduced\&. This has required the development of specific GDI Dlls for each target type i\&.e\&. RS08, HCS08, CFV1 and CFV2-4\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The handling of RS08 devices has been further changed and now no RS08 derivative specific code is contained in the BDM firmware or USBDM\&.dll\&. RS08 code is handled by the GDI layer for Codewarrior V10 or in the OpenSourceBDM\&.dll for the older version of Codewarrior\&.

.IP "\(bu" 2
Major revision\&. The structure of the software has been revised and the operation with various targets made more uniform\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Introduction of a new API for using the BDM\&. Existing APIs (TBDML, OSBDM, TBLCF) are now supported by a separate compatibility layer\&. This has resulted in a very significant reduction in the complexity of both the BDM firmware and the interface DLLs\&. The previous arrangement was becoming impossible to maintain\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The handling of RS08 devices has been re-written in a more sensible fashion\&. This involved moving the bulk of the RS08 code from the BDM firmware to the interface DLLs\&. This should mean that additional devices can be introduced without changing the BDM firmware\&. Support for additional RS08 devices has been added\&. The BDM now supports KA1, KA2, KA4, KA8, LA8 and LE4\&.

Because of the above changes, the BDM \fBREQUIRES\fP the use of the provided interface DLLs\&. The BDM is no longer compatible with the original TBDML or OSBDM dlls\&.

.IP "\(bu" 2
The devices supported are limited to those that I've had a chance to investigate\&. The configuration for particular devices are contained in the various \fBxxxx_devices\&.xml\fP files\&. This may be modified by hand to include other devices if they are similar to those already supported i\&.e\&. have a supported clock type and the usual type of Flash memory\&.
.br

.IP "\(bu" 2
EEPROM (HCS12) and dual-flash (CFV1) are supported but not extensively tested\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
The programmer \fBrequires\fP the use of USBDM Ver 4\&.9 or later BDMs with \fBmatching firmware\fP\&. It should be possible to adapt the software to the OSBDM API relatively easily\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Note that Coldfire+ & Kinetis devices are limited to basic Flash programming and partitioning of FlexNVM\&. Programming of EEEPROM (simulated EEPROM) is not supported\&. Any region of FlexNVM not allocated to EEEPROM backing store may ben programmed as conventional Flash\&.
.PP
.SH "Unusual Errors"
.PP
The following error indicates that the memory image being programmed contains data outside of the Flash memory of the target\&. This includes the target RAM\&.
.br
 The USBDM stand-alone programmer produces an error because it doesn't make sense to 'program' something to, for example, RAM\&. If your program image contains data destined to RAM then it would (usually) indicate that there is a mistake in the memory map since such data would be lost when the target is reset\&. It seems sensible to flag this as an error\&.
.PP
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
Common Reason
.br
 When using the trace function in Codewarrior with KL targets it creates a buffer in RAM to store the trace information\&. It also includes an zeroed region in the binary file image to initialise the buffer to zero when the image is loaded into the target\&. This situation is accepted by USBDM when working within Codewarrior since it makes some sense to download 'stuff' to RAM when debugging a target\&. For example, during development you might want to run a program entirely in RAM\&.
.br

.br
 
.br
 Solution - You should turn off the trace function when producing a final image for production\&. This is sensible in any case since tracing should not (normally) be in use in the production target\&.
.br

.br
 When I have time I will consider adding an option to the programmer to ignore writes to RAM but I really think this is of little value since it is better to alert you to what is likely an error or at least an oversight\&.

Codewarrior Legacy
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Trim programming is not supported on older Codewarrior version\&. It is only available in the Eclipse version and stand-alone programmers\&. Trimming is done by Codewarrior not USBDM in the earlier versions\&. It is simply not implemented by Codewarrior (despite there being a nice dialogue box!)\&. I can't do anything about this\&. It is NOT a bug in USBDM\&. 
.br

.PP

.IP "\(bu" 2
HCS12 
.br
.IP "  \(bu" 4
The use of WAI or STOP instructions on HCS12 targets with the clocks disabled will cause the BDM to lose connection\&. There is no solution to this as it is a target BDM limitation\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
The use of WAI or STOP instructions on HCS12 targets with the clocks enabled will cause the BDM target connection to become unreliable when the target is executing\&. This will cause the debugger to occasionally update the screen incorrectly and to report that the target is starting or stopping (in the status area)\&. The screen will be correctly updated when the target is next halted so this is more of a cosmetic problem\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
On early HCS12 targets (Version <4 BDM interfaces) there may be some minor problems with single-stepping when using a clock multiplier\&. The reason is unknown but I suspect it is a limitation of the Target BDM hardware\&. Enabling the 'Force BDM Clock Source' option and selecting 'Bus clock' prevents this problem but results in a very high frequency for the BDM interface\&.

568xx 
.br
.IP "  \(bu" 4
The Codewarrior 56800E Flash Programmer does not work with the USBDM GDI interface\&. I cannot find a reason for this but since it doesn't work with OSBDM either I suspect that the GDI interface on the programmer is broken\&.
.br

.IP "  \(bu" 4
The support of MC56F80xx devices by the programmer is very limited since the devices differ significantly in their operation\&. To add a device requires considerable work although this has improved somewhat recently\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
MC56F80xx devices are NOT supported in the Codewarrior Eclipse version since this version uses extension to the GDI API that are undocumented\&. Some devices may be programmed but the debugging operation is limited as Flash based breakpoints are not properly supported\&.
.PP

.IP "\(bu" 2
Coldfire
.IP "  \(bu" 4
The use of low power modes and STOP instructions has some issues on Coldfire V2, 3 & 4 targets\&.
.IP "    \(bu" 6
Despite what the device manuals indicates it is not always possible to wake the target using the BKPT signal\&. In some cases the only usable method is to reset the target\&. 
.br
 Because of this, it may be desirable to disable the automatic re-connect option as it may lead to unintended resets when the BDM polls a sleeping target\&. 
.br

.IP "    \(bu" 6
A reset may still be done if the debugger tries to halt the target when sleeping (after unsuccessful BKPT attempts)\&. This situation is reported to the user\&.
.br
 The only guaranteed workaround for this problem it to use the RUN mode in the LPCR register although it should not be a real problem provided the target is not continuously sleeping i\&.e\&. it is being regularly woken by interrupts etc\&.
.IP "    \(bu" 6
If not using the PST signals it may not be possible to differentiate between STOP (the target is sleeping but is considered to still be executing) and HALT (the target is suspended to allow debugging) states\&. 
.br
 Because of this the debugger may incorrectly indicate that the target is halted when it is actually stopped (waiting for interrupts etc)\&. This also varies with the actual sleep mode selected\&. It is necessary to restart code execution and then halt the target to synchronise the debugger state if this occurs\&.
.br
 There is no workaround for this problem as it is a limitation of the register polling method used in lieu of the PST signals\&.

It is possible to program the these devices with an invalid program that will make it difficult to connect in debug mode\&. 
.br
 This can be the case if the device is suffering from a reset trap or watch-dog timer failure\&. In these cases it is necessary to do a mass erase of the device to restore function\&. Since it is difficult to identify this situation the programmers and Codewarrior interfaces may not do this automatically\&. If connection problems are encountered it may be necessary to use the mass erase option on the \fBstand-alone programmer\fP to erase the device\&.

If the flash has been protected (using FDPROT etc\&.) then it is necessary to use the Mass-erase option for programming\&. I believe this is due to a hardware bug in the devices\&. (FDPROT etc are NOT writable in debug mode\&.)

.IP "\(bu" 2
The previous version of the JM & JS BDMs used a 10M resistor for the crystal clock bias\&. I have discovered that this value is intended for lower frequency cystals\&. A 1M resistor is recommended\&. I have had no problems with boards using the 10M value but there may be some issues with some crystals or chips\&. I don't recommend changing the value in existing hardware unless there are problems\&.
