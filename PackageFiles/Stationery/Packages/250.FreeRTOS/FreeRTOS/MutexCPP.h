/**
 * @brief Mutex Wrapper.
 *
 * A Mutex is a basic synchronization primitive allowing mutual exclusion to be
 * handled which also implements priority inheritance. Note, the basic mutex is
 * NOT recursive, ie if a Task has taken the Mutex, it must not try to take it
 * again before giving it. If you need this, use a RecurviseMutex.
 *
 * The usage of a Mutex is similar to a semaphore, but the task that takes the
 * Mutex is also supposed to be the Task that eventually gives it back. It also
 * doesn't normally make sense for an ISR to use a Mutex, so no _ISR routines
 * have been made available.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 * @code
 * RecursiveMutex mutex("MyMutex");
 *
 * // In some other task
 * mutex.take();
 * ... // some code that needs mutual exclusion
 * mutex.give();
 * @endcode
 *

/**
 * @brief Recursive Mutex Wrapper.
 *
 * A RecursiveMutex adds the ability to nest takes, so that if you have taken the
 * RecursiveMutex and take it again, this works and requires you to give the
 * RecursiveMutex back as many times as it was taken before it is released.
 *
 * One very common application for this is for messages to the user on a console.
 * Generally, you don't want pieces of a message interrupted by pieces of other
 * messages, so message output routines use a mutex on the console port.
 * These routines often use lower level routines that also want to make sure their
 * output isn't interspersed, so each level takes the RecursiveMutex at their start
 * and releases it at the end. Being a RecursiveMutex this works.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 * @code
 * RecursiveMutex mutex("MyMutex");
 *
 * // In some other task
 * mutex.take();
 * ...
 *  // possible in a recursive call or call to lower level routine.
 *  mutex.take();
 *  ...
 *  mutex.give();
 * ...
 * mutex.give();
 *
 * @endcode
