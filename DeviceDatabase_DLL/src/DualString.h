/**
\brief Dual-purpose (and two-faced) string: wraps a string (XMLCh* or char*)
and lets you access it in either form.

This is a value-added version of the "StrX" class from Xerces-C examples.

NOTE: the constructor COPIES the string it's given, so beware of using loose
strings as ctor parameters.  One reason to duplicate it to guarantee the
const char* string is allocated from the Xerces memory pool and therefore may
be freed using Xerces functions.

As a value-add feature, this class could store a std::string instead of a char*
and thus provide accessors to return "const std::string&" as well as "const char*".
Perhaps in a future version.

/**
\\brief Converts between XMLCh* and char* strings, and takes ownership of the
newly-created string.

It's a wrapper around and an alternative to direct XMLString::transcode()
calls, which require the calling code to manually/individually free the memory
of the returned strings.

This class releases all of the owned pointers in its destructor.  You can
either pass a StringManager pointer around a set of related classes and perform all
of the memory cleanup at the end (with a single delete() call); or create a
StringManager object and let scoping rules trigger the destructor for you.

Several decisions were made in the design of this class:

- there were originally member functions to take ownership of arbitrary XMLCh*
  and char* strings; but since there's no way to tell from which memory pool
  those came (general heap or private/custom Xerces allocator) this was scrapped.
  As such, this class only manages its own strings, that is, ones initiated by
  internal calls to XMLString::transcode()

- Strings are stored internally as non-const pointers, and convert() returns
  the same.  Client code can still store convert() results as const pointers,
  but calls disown() for those same strings would require a cast.  (disown()
  does an internal lookup of the string and that requires us to search by
  non-const pointer.)
